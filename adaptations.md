## Garamond
Garamond is a group of many serif typefaces, named for sixteenth-century Parisian engraver Claude Garamond, generally spelled as Garamont in his lifetime. 
It is common to pair it with *italics* based on those created by his contemporary **Robert Granjon**, who was well known for his proficiency in this genre.
Sixty years after Garamond's death, the French printer **Jean Jannon** released a specimen of typefaces in the Garamond/Granjon style.

## Bembo
Bembo is an attractive, legible book typeface. Prominent users of Bembo have included Penguin Books, the Everyman's Library series, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, the National Gallery, Yale University Press and Edward Tufte. Created by the British branch of the Monotype Corporation in 1928–1929.
Its regular or roman style based on a design cut around 1495 by Francesco Griffo for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius, sometimes generically called the "Aldine roman". The italic is based on work by Giovanni Antonio Tagliente, a calligrapher who worked as a printer in the 1520s, after the time of Manutius and Griffo.
Bembo is named for Manutius's first publication with it, a small 1496 book by the poet and cleric Pietro Bembo.
