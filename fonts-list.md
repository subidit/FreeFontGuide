# Vox-ATypI classification (depricated)

1. Classicals (*Oldstyle Serif*)
   1. Humanist: imitates the formal hands found in the humanistic (renaissance) manuscripts (15th century, Venetian printers).
   2. Garalde: (Aldine) have finer proportions than the humanists, and a stronger contrast between downstroke and upstroke.
   3. Transitional: (Realist) Even more contrast between main and connecting strokes.

2. Moderns
   1. Didone: hairline serifs.  
   2. Mechanistic: Slab-Serif.
   3. Lineal: Sans-Serif
      1. Grotesque: some degree of contrast between thick and thin strokes.
      2. Neo-grotesque: less stroke contrast and a more regular design. 
      3. Geometric: constructed from simple geometric shapes, circles or rectangles.
      4. Humanist: relate to the earlier, classical handwritten monumental Roman capitals and a lowercase similar in form to the Carolingian script. 

3. Calligraphics
   1. Glyphic: (Incised) incised, or incise are typefaces which evoke the engraving or chiseling of characters in stone or metal, as opposed to calligraphic handwriting.
   2. Script: typefaces which evoke the formal penmanship of cursive writing. They seem to be written with a quill and have a strong slope.
   3. Graphic: are based on hand-drawn originals which are slowly written with either a brush, pen, pencil, or other writing instrument. 
   4. Blackletter: are characterized by pointed and angular forms, and are modeled on late medieval hands written with a broad-nibbed pen.
   5. Gaelic (Insular script)

4. Non-Latin

## Notes

* Amasis was designed by typeface designer Ron Carpenter for the Monotype foundry in 1990. It has five weights, from Light to Black, with a true italic companion for each. Amasis has been used as a default font for the Nook e-reader.
* Type designer René Bieder designed Sagona in the “Clarendon” style, which was first popularized in the 19th century. He gave Sagona a warmer, more welcoming look than most Clarendon-style typefaces, which is especially noticeable in the almost bouncy upright lowercase ‘a’ and the jaunty curliless of the italic letters. Sagona has three weights, Book, Book Bold, and ExtraLight, each with its accompanying italic style.
* Selawik was created for Microsoft by type designer Aaron Bell. It is compatible in character widths with Segoe UI, the typeface used for the user interface in Microsoft Windows. The purpose of Selawik was to provide a open-source sans serif compatible font for users on Mac, iOS, or Android, but it has become a popular typeface in its own right among Windows users.
* Type designer Erin McLaughlin designed Tenorite for Microsoft. It has two weights, Regular and Bold, with slanted romans as complementary italic styles; it has the same weights and italic styles in its Display variation, which is designed for use a large sizes.
* Trade Gothic was originally designed by Jackson Burke in 1948 for Linotype hot-metal typesetting. Trade Gothic Next was created in 2008 by Linotype Type Director, Akira Kobayashi, and American type designer Tom Grace, refining many details to make it successful as a computer typeface. Trade Gothic Next has four weights, Light, Regular, Bold, and Heavy, each with an oblique companion as its italic style; it also has three weights in a narrow width, Condensed, Condensed Bold, and Condensed Heavy, each with its italic complement. In addition, the family includes two unusual variations: SoftRound (Regular and Bold), with rounded ends to the strokes, and an all-capitals Inline and Inline Bold, with thin white lines inside each stroke.
* Walbaum is an expansion of the original metal typefaces designed by Justus Erich Walbaum in Germany in the early 1800s. Monotype designers Carl Crossgrove and Charles Nix discovered their mutual enthusiasm for Walbaum’s types and took on the task of updating them, Crossgrove taking the text sizes and Nix handling the larger display range.
* Book Antiqua by Monotype - distributed with Microsoft Windows before licensing Palatino Linotype in Windows 2000.


## Gossip

- MRS EAVES designed by Zuzana Licko in 1996 is a variant of BASKERVILLE and named after Sarah Eaves, the woman who became John Baskerville's wife. As Baskerville was setting up his printing and type business, he hired Sarah Eaves as his live-in housekeeper; eventually, her husband Richard abandoned her and their five children, and Mrs Eaves became Baskerville's mistress and eventual helpmate with typesetting and printing. She married Baskerville within a month of her estranged husband's death.
- ERIC GILL had several extramarital affairs. His other deviant sexual behaviours include, as described in his personal diaries, the child sexual abuse of his adolescent daughters, an incestuous relationship with at least one of his sisters and also sexual experiments with a dog.
- Univers was intrinsically superior to Helvetica. It had a much larger family at the outset, with 21 members compared to four in 1960. More importantly, its family was logically designed with consistent weights and widths, something that Helvetica never achieved until its redesign as Neue Helvetica in 1982. Univers’ characters, stripped of “unnecessary” elements such as the beard on ‘G’ or the curve on the tail of ‘y,’ were also more rationally designed. [link](https://www.printmag.com/design-culture/univers-of-helvetica-history/)
- FUTURA was preferred by the Nazis after they banned the use of Fraktur typefaced because of its visual similarity to Hebrew. This killed off Fraktur from any modern use other than, for example, heavy-metal bands and tattoos.
- Tobias Frere-Jones filed a lawsuit against his erstwhile partner, Jonathan Hoefler, claiming that he’d been cheated out of his half of Hoefler & Frere-Jones.
