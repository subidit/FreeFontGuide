# Vox-ATypI classification (depricated)

1. Classicals (*Oldstyle Serif*)
   1. Humanist: imitates the formal hands found in the humanistic (renaissance) manuscripts (15th century, Venetian printers).
   2. Garalde: (Aldine) have finer proportions than the humanists, and a stronger contrast between downstroke and upstroke.
   3. Transitional: (Realist) Even more contrast between main and connecting strokes.

2. Moderns
   1. Didone: hairline serifs.  
   2. Mechanistic: Slab-Serif.
   3. Lineal: Sans-Serif
      1. Grotesque: some degree of contrast between thick and thin strokes.
      2. Neo-grotesque: less stroke contrast and a more regular design. 
      3. Geometric: constructed from simple geometric shapes, circles or rectangles.
      4. Humanist: relate to the earlier, classical handwritten monumental Roman capitals and a lowercase similar in form to the Carolingian script. 

3. Calligraphics
   1. Glyphic: (Incised) incised, or incise are typefaces which evoke the engraving or chiseling of characters in stone or metal, as opposed to calligraphic handwriting.
   2. Script: typefaces which evoke the formal penmanship of cursive writing. They seem to be written with a quill and have a strong slope.
   3. Graphic: are based on hand-drawn originals which are slowly written with either a brush, pen, pencil, or other writing instrument. 
   4. Blackletter: are characterized by pointed and angular forms, and are modeled on late medieval hands written with a broad-nibbed pen.
   5. Gaelic (Insular script)

4. Non-Latin

## Font File Formats

1. **TrueType (.ttf):** Developed by Apple and Microsoft in the late 1980s, TrueType fonts are widely used and supported by both operating systems. They contain both the font outlines and the font instructions for rendering glyphs.

2. **OpenType (.otf):** A more versatile and modern font format developed by Adobe and Microsoft. OpenType fonts can contain more glyphs (characters), support more languages, include advanced typographic features, and have better cross-platform compatibility. OpenType fonts can also be either TrueType-based or PostScript-based.

3. **PostScript Type 1 (.pfb, .pfm):** Developed by Adobe, PostScript fonts were widely used in the past. They contain vector outlines of characters and were commonly used for printing. However, they've largely been replaced by OpenType fonts due to their limitations.

4. **Web Open Font Format (WOFF, WOFF2):** These formats are specifically optimized for web use. WOFF and WOFF2 are compressed font formats that help improve web page loading times by reducing file sizes. They are based on OpenType or TrueType fonts and are widely supported by modern web browsers.

5. **Embedded OpenType (EOT):** Another font format developed by Microsoft specifically for Internet Explorer. EOT fonts were created to address some security and licensing issues for web fonts but have been largely replaced by WOFF and WOFF2 formats.

6. **SVG Fonts (.svg):** Based on Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), these fonts use XML to describe glyphs, and each character is defined using vector graphics. SVG fonts are less common and have been largely superseded by other formats due to limitations in features and compatibility.

7. **Variable Fonts:** Variable fonts contain multiple variations of a typeface (weight, width, slant, etc.) within a single file. They enable real-time adjustment of these attributes along a continuous spectrum, allowing for infinite possibilities of styles and weights. They offer dynamic control over attributes like weight, width, slant, and optical size, allowing smoother transitions between styles and enabling designers to fine-tune typography for various screen sizes, resolutions, and environments. They also reduce the number of HTTP requests and file downloads on the web, enhancing performance by delivering multiple font styles in a single file.


## Notes

* Amasis was designed by typeface designer Ron Carpenter for the Monotype foundry in 1990. It has five weights, from Light to Black, with a true italic companion for each. Amasis has been used as a default font for the Nook e-reader.
* Type designer René Bieder designed Sagona in the “Clarendon” style, which was first popularized in the 19th century. He gave Sagona a warmer, more welcoming look than most Clarendon-style typefaces, which is especially noticeable in the almost bouncy upright lowercase ‘a’ and the jaunty curliless of the italic letters. Sagona has three weights, Book, Book Bold, and ExtraLight, each with its accompanying italic style.
* Selawik was created for Microsoft by type designer Aaron Bell. It is compatible in character widths with Segoe UI, the typeface used for the user interface in Microsoft Windows. The purpose of Selawik was to provide a open-source sans serif compatible font for users on Mac, iOS, or Android, but it has become a popular typeface in its own right among Windows users.
* Type designer Erin McLaughlin designed Tenorite for Microsoft. It has two weights, Regular and Bold, with slanted romans as complementary italic styles; it has the same weights and italic styles in its Display variation, which is designed for use a large sizes.
* Trade Gothic was originally designed by Jackson Burke in 1948 for Linotype hot-metal typesetting. Trade Gothic Next was created in 2008 by Linotype Type Director, Akira Kobayashi, and American type designer Tom Grace, refining many details to make it successful as a computer typeface. Trade Gothic Next has four weights, Light, Regular, Bold, and Heavy, each with an oblique companion as its italic style; it also has three weights in a narrow width, Condensed, Condensed Bold, and Condensed Heavy, each with its italic complement. In addition, the family includes two unusual variations: SoftRound (Regular and Bold), with rounded ends to the strokes, and an all-capitals Inline and Inline Bold, with thin white lines inside each stroke.
* Walbaum is an expansion of the original metal typefaces designed by Justus Erich Walbaum in Germany in the early 1800s. Monotype designers Carl Crossgrove and Charles Nix discovered their mutual enthusiasm for Walbaum’s types and took on the task of updating them, Crossgrove taking the text sizes and Nix handling the larger display range.
* Book Antiqua by Monotype - distributed with Microsoft Windows before licensing Palatino Linotype in Windows 2000.


## Gossip

- MRS EAVES designed by Zuzana Licko in 1996 is a variant of BASKERVILLE and named after Sarah Eaves, the woman who became John Baskerville's wife. As Baskerville was setting up his printing and type business, he hired Sarah Eaves as his live-in housekeeper; eventually, her husband Richard abandoned her and their five children, and Mrs Eaves became Baskerville's mistress and eventual helpmate with typesetting and printing. She married Baskerville within a month of her estranged husband's death.
- ERIC GILL had several extramarital affairs. His other deviant sexual behaviours include, as described in his personal diaries, the child sexual abuse of his adolescent daughters, an incestuous relationship with at least one of his sisters and also sexual experiments with a dog.
- Univers was intrinsically superior to Helvetica. It had a much larger family at the outset, with 21 members compared to four in 1960. More importantly, its family was logically designed with consistent weights and widths, something that Helvetica never achieved until its redesign as Neue Helvetica in 1982. Univers’ characters, stripped of “unnecessary” elements such as the beard on ‘G’ or the curve on the tail of ‘y,’ were also more rationally designed. [link](https://www.printmag.com/design-culture/univers-of-helvetica-history/)
- FUTURA was preferred by the Nazis after they banned the use of Fraktur typefaced because of its visual similarity to Hebrew. This killed off Fraktur from any modern use other than, for example, heavy-metal bands and tattoos.
- Tobias Frere-Jones filed a lawsuit against his erstwhile partner, Jonathan Hoefler, claiming that he’d been cheated out of his half of Hoefler & Frere-Jones.

<!--

## Key rules 

- The typographic quality of your document is determined largely by how the body text looks.
- The appearance of the body text is determined primarily by these four typographic choices:
1. Font choice - avoid default fonts.
2. Point size - 10–12 pt for print. 15–25 px on web.
3. Line spacing - 120–145% of the point size.
4. Line length - 45–90 characters per line. 

### Visual Hierarchy

There are a variety of elements that work together to create a typographic hierarchy, including:

1. Size & Weight
2. Positioning & Alignment
3. Color 
4. Contrast
5. Case
6. Typeface

## Font Superfamilies

The norm in a superfamily is to start from an identical character shape then adding class-specific features such as serifs to that shape. The result is a set of fonts with a similar appearance that belong to different classes such as sans, serif, slab serif, rounded.
In typography, a font superfamily or typeface superfamily is a font family containing fonts that fall into multiple classifications.

* **GNU FreeFont** - FreeSans, FreeSerif, FreeMono
* **Meta** - comprising FF Meta (sans), FF Meta Serif and FF Meta Headline
* **Scala** - comprising FF Scala (serif) and FF Scala Sans
* **Merriweather** - comprising Merriweather and Merriweather Sans
* **PT Fonts** - The Public Type or PT Fonts comprises of PT Serif, PT Sans and PT Mono.
* **Source** - comprising Source Sans Pro, Source Serif Pro and Source Code Pro
* **Thesis** - comprising TheSans, TheSerif, TheMix and TheAntiqua
* **Computer Modern** - comprising cmr (antiqua), cmss (grotesque) and cmtt (monospaced)
* **DejaVu** and **Bitstream Vera** - comprising DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Sans Mono and DejaVu Serif.
* **IBM Plex** - comprising IBM Plex Sans, IBM Plex Sans Condensed, IBM Plex Serif and IBM Plex Mono
* **Noto** fonts - comprising Noto Sans, Noto Serif and Noto Mono, an expansion of the Droid family. It supports a wide range of languages.
* **Droid** - comprising Droid Sans, Droid Serif and Droid Sans Mono.
* **Roboto** - comprising Roboto, Roboto Slab and Roboto Mono

## Knowledge Base

**Font Formats**

1. **TrueType (.ttf):** Developed by Apple and Microsoft in the late 1980s, TrueType fonts are widely used and supported by both operating systems. They contain both the font outlines and the font instructions for rendering glyphs.

2. **OpenType (.otf):** A more versatile and modern font format developed by Adobe and Microsoft. OpenType fonts can contain more glyphs (characters), support more languages, include advanced typographic features, and have better cross-platform compatibility. OpenType fonts can also be either TrueType-based or PostScript-based.

3. **PostScript Type 1 (.pfb, .pfm):** Developed by Adobe, PostScript fonts were widely used in the past. They contain vector outlines of characters and were commonly used for printing. However, they've largely been replaced by OpenType fonts due to their limitations.

4. **Web Open Font Format (WOFF, WOFF2):** These formats are specifically optimized for web use. WOFF and WOFF2 are compressed font formats that help improve web page loading times by reducing file sizes. They are based on OpenType or TrueType fonts and are widely supported by modern web browsers.

5. **Embedded OpenType (EOT):** Another font format developed by Microsoft specifically for Internet Explorer. EOT fonts were created to address some security and licensing issues for web fonts but have been largely replaced by WOFF and WOFF2 formats.

6. **SVG Fonts (.svg):** Based on Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), these fonts use XML to describe glyphs, and each character is defined using vector graphics. SVG fonts are less common and have been largely superseded by other formats due to limitations in features and compatibility.

7. **TrueType GX/AAT fonts:** These are variations of the TrueType format that support advanced typography and layout features. They were developed by Apple and are not widely used.

**Variable Fonts**

Variable fonts are a relatively recent innovation in font technology that differ significantly from traditional static or non-variable fonts. Here are the key differences between variable fonts and other types of fonts:

**Variable Fonts:**
   - **Variability:** Variable fonts contain multiple variations of a typeface (weight, width, slant, etc.) within a single file. They enable real-time adjustment of these attributes along a continuous spectrum, allowing for infinite possibilities of styles and weights.
   - **File Size:** Variable fonts typically have smaller file sizes compared to a collection of individual static fonts since they contain multiple variations in a single file.
   - **Flexibility:** They offer dynamic control over attributes like weight, width, slant, and optical size, allowing smoother transitions between styles and enabling designers to fine-tune typography for various screen sizes, resolutions, and environments.
   - **Efficiency:** They reduce the number of HTTP requests and file downloads on the web, enhancing performance by delivering multiple font styles in a single file.
   - **Support:** While gaining traction, variable font support is still evolving across different platforms, software, and browsers. However, major platforms and software increasingly support variable fonts.

**Static or Non-Variable Fonts:**
   - **Individual Files:** Traditional fonts come as separate files for each style or weight (e.g., Regular, Bold, Italic, etc.), with each file containing a single style or variation.
   - **Limited Styles:** Each font file represents a specific style or weight, and using different styles requires downloading separate files, leading to more significant file sizes if numerous styles are needed.
   - **File Size:** As a result of having separate files for different styles, the overall file size can be larger when compared to variable fonts, especially when including multiple styles or weights.
   - **Fixed Styles:** Static fonts have fixed styles, and any interpolation between styles requires separate font files or modifying the design itself.

## Font Superfamilies

The norm in a superfamily is to start from an identical character shape then adding class-specific features such as serifs to that shape. The result is a set of fonts with a similar appearance that belong to different classes such as sans, serif, slab serif, rounded.
In typography, a font superfamily or typeface superfamily is a font family containing fonts that fall into multiple classifications.

* **GNU FreeFont** - FreeSans, FreeSerif, FreeMono
* **Meta** - comprising FF Meta (sans), FF Meta Serif and FF Meta Headline
* **Scala** - comprising FF Scala (serif) and FF Scala Sans
* **Merriweather** - comprising Merriweather and Merriweather Sans
* **PT Fonts** - The Public Type or PT Fonts comprises of PT Serif, PT Sans and PT Mono.
* **Source** - comprising Source Sans Pro, Source Serif Pro and Source Code Pro
* **Thesis** - comprising TheSans, TheSerif, TheMix and TheAntiqua
* **Computer Modern** - comprising cmr (antiqua), cmss (grotesque) and cmtt (monospaced)
* **DejaVu** and **Bitstream Vera** - comprising DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Sans Mono and DejaVu Serif.
* **IBM Plex** - comprising IBM Plex Sans, IBM Plex Sans Condensed, IBM Plex Serif and IBM Plex Mono
* **Noto** fonts - comprising Noto Sans, Noto Serif and Noto Mono, an expansion of the Droid family. It supports a wide range of languages.
* **Droid** - comprising Droid Sans, Droid Serif and Droid Sans Mono.
